# Colour Grid
A colour can be represented by the RGB colour model where each character can be represented .

## Task 1.1
Create a function `generate_2d_list()` that generates a 2-D list, prompting the user for the number of colours they want to generate.
The number of colours have to be a perfect square that is between 9 and 100.
Each list in the 2-D list should have exactly 3 indexes where each index is a random number between 0 to 255.
Print out the 2-D list row by row. <br>
Example: <br>
[[246, 161, 135] <br>
[109, 236, 50] <br>
[177, 160, 130] <br>
[49, 236, 172] <br>
[191, 6, 28] <br>
[167, 203, 168] <br>
[64, 149, 124] <br>
[250, 36, 54] <br>
[244, 171, 99]]
